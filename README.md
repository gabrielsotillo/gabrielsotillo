# ${About\ {\color{lightblue}me}}\ $

 My name is **Gabriel Sotillo**, but you can call me **Gabo**. I have more than 8 years of experience in the area of systems, software, data backup, remote assistance, and user support. I worked 2 years developing VBA scripts for Microsoft Excel and Word.
 
 Currently I am **learning** application development in **Python**, so that I can be a **full-stack programmer** in near the future.
